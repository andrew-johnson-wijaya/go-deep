- **Win/Lose Conditions:**
  - **Win Condition:** There is no final "win" — the goal is to survive as long as possible and maintain a stable mental state.
  - **Lose Conditions:**
    - Physical death from hunger, injuries, or environmental hazards.
    - Mental breakdown (stress, panic, or despair reaching critical levels), causing the character to give up or make fatal mistakes.
